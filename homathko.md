# Homathko
Project Homathko is a mission designed to leverage the systems developed for ECOSat-II and adapt them for use in a lower-cost 1U cubesat. Essentially, Homathko operates as a stripped-down version of ECOSat-II, with the following changes:

* Primary scientific payload removed.
* Secondary payload promoted to primary payload.
* Number of battery cells reduced from 8 to 4.
* ADCS removed and replaced with passive magnetic stabilization.

The mission objective is to operate as an amateur radio relay satellite (an OSCAR, or Orbiting Satellite Carrying Amateur Radio). The secondary mission objectives are systems qualification and educational outreach. The primary OSCAR payload will operate as a mode U/V amateur radio repeater, with a 70 cm amateur band uplink and a 2m band downlink. Through use of a custom-designed software defined radio board, the 1U cubesat will be able to simultaneously operate three communications services off a single communications system:

* A narrowband FM voice repeater,
* A QPSK packet-switched mode with forward error correction, and
* A linear transponder.

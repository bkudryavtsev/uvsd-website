about_text:
  The University of Victoria Satellite Design Team (UVSD) is a collective of undergraduate
  and graduate students from the faculties of Engineering, Social Sciences, and Commerce who are dedicated
  to the development of cutting edge satellites, and giving students the hands-on experience they need to
  be competitive in todays aerospace industry.
  <br/><br/>

  <b>UVSDs mandate is to</b>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide hands-on skills to students.</li>
    <li>Develop cutting edge satellites.</li>
    <li>Inspire the next generation of thinkers, tinkerers, and doers.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>While our passion for space technology and satellite development is what brought us together, professional
  skills development is at the core of the club’s purpose. From marketing and project management to
  software and design work, UVSD aims to provide students with the opportunity to develop a solid base
  of technical skills in an environment where they are free to work on the projects they choose and
  experiment with new ideas.

  At UVSD, we think outside the box about what we can do inside the box.
  Given the constraints associated with small satellite development, innovation is a
  prerequisite for mission success, and our approach to solving these difficult problems
  has lead to designs that are being adopted by student satellite teams across Canada.</p>

homathko_title: Project Homathko
homathko_img: assets/img/sat1.jpg
homathko_text:
  Project Homathko cube-satellite strives to carry a LASER payload for the
  Airborne Laser for Telescopic Atmospheric Interference Reduction (ALTAIR) project.
  LASERs will be fired in space to measure atmospheric interference. Ground telescopes
  would use the data collected by Homathko to compensate the distortions caused by the
  atmosphere. The achievement would allow telescopes to view the celestial objects more clearly.
  Thus advancing technological innovation in astronomy and aerospace engineering.

orcaasat_title: ORCA<sup>2</sup>SAT
orcaasat_img: assets/img/ORCAASAT_patch.png
orcaasat_text:
  ORCAASat (Optical and Radio Calibration of Atmospheric Attenuation CubeSat) is a multi-payload,
  collaborative effort between teams at the University of Victoria, Simon Fraser University,
  the University of British Columbia, and Instituto Superior Técnico in Lisbon, Portugal.
  <br/></br/>
  Like Homathko, ORCAASat will be used to calibrate ground based star photometers and
  observatories for atmospheric and instrumental attenuation, additionally, its radio
  source will be used to calibrate the CHIME (Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment)
  radio observatory.

ecosat3_title: ECOSat III
ecosat3_img: assets/img/ECOSAT3.png
ecosat3_text:
  EcoSat III’s primary payload was a hyperspectral camera intended to provide open source hyperspectral images of
  Canada at 150m spatial resolution. These images could be used to identify various geological or natural features
  such as deforestation due to pine beetles, receding glaciers, water pollution and forest fires.
  EcoSat III was designed to have a downlink capability of 10 Mbit/s, had the system been deployed,
  this would have been a first for cube satellites.

ecosat2_title: ECOSat II
ecosat2_img: assets/img/ECOSAT2.png
ecosat2_text:
  The main goal of EcoSat II was to demonstrate that diamagnetic materials could be used in the
  control systems of small space craft. EcoSat II’s secondary goal was to test the feasibility of
  pyrolytic graphite as a lightweight radiation shield for small satellites. EcoSat II won first place
  in the Canadian Satellite Design Challenge, securing a launch into orbit but has so far not been launched.
